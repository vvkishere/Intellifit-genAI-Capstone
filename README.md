# Intellifit-genAI-Capstone

Intellifit is an agentic workflow to enhance and aguement users who want to get to their fitness goals but aren't able to find high quality trainer teams to help them with their fitness journey.

The system will be able to ingest all kinds of user data including medical health records, user current emotional and physical state, user goals and progress towards the goals to give them a customized, regular feedback on their journey and keeping them on track.

This system is built as a prototype for the "Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1" for Kaggle and will incorporate the following GenAI Capabilities:

Controlled Generation
Few shot prompting
Document understanding
Agents
Function Calling
Context Caching
While the larger system is complex and will need to comprehensively cover several areas, for the purpose of this capstone project we will build and incorporate a limited set of workflows to demonstrate the potential of this system. Currently the system will generate a set of questions for the user when onboarding them onto the system, a Nutritionist Agent will recommend daily meals and a trainer agent will use the data to create a custom plan on a daily basis.
